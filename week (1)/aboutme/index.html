    <h2>Name: Michael Helm</h2>
    <h2>Nickname: Mike</h2>
    <p>Hi all, my name is Mike Helm. I am from Pocatello, Idaho. I am an army brat who has lived all over the US and even in Bogotá, Colombia and Panamá City, Panamá. I served a mission in the West Indies Mission from 2013-2015. I met my wife when I was a dumb 17 year old kid in Panama and we got married in 2017. We have one 2 year old daughter who is already turning my hair white</p>
    
    <p>I'm currently going after the CS degree which will open more doors in my career path in the world of medical market research. I plan to finally finish my bachelors in 2024 and be done... for now. Something that my work has put into practice is a booking tool, where we can book interviews and other things without needing to call the participants. Having worked with the programmers behind it has given me a much larger sense of appreciation for how they designed it and got it to work. I hope that by taking this course I will be able to expand my knowledge a bit more and be able to eventually soar with those eagles (the programmers, lol)</p>
    <p>I was born into the church but I have been a member since I was 8 years old. I think one of my favorite scriptures is Proverbs 21:19 "It is better to dwell in the wilderness than with a contentious and angry woman" I have definitely seen that in my life as a married man</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>WHAT ELSE</h2>
    <p>I love video games and hunting, and cooking. I hunt whenever I can, but during school I can't, so... my wife is happy because I am saving money by staying at home :P </p>
