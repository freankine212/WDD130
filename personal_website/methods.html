            <h2>Rifles</h2>
            <p>Rifles are a relatively new method used for hunting game. They were initially used for war in the Middle Ages but have evolved to not just be for war but also for hunting and fun. There is a sense of joy and glee at taking down your prey from more than 200 yards away. Knowing that you are the apex predator there to provide for your family is a feeling that one can only get when harvesting their own meat. There are many different types of rifles for many different types of people.</p>

            <h2>Archery</h2>
            <p>Bows have been around for thousands of years. Mongols use short bows to battle and to hunt with. The British in the middle ages used bows for battle and also to hunt with. Compared to rifle hunting, bow hunting is a different ball game entirely. When hunting with a bow the objective is to get anywhere from 5 yards to maybe at most 70 yards to successfully hit and harvest the target. Archery can be divided into three camps, Longbows, Compound Bows and even Crossbows. All three are viable methods of take when it comes to hunting. There are many different types of each type of bow and they all work for the intended purposes made for.</p>

            <h2>Crossbows</h2>
            <p>Crossbows are a step in archery hunting. They were initially developed to punch through knights armor in a battle but now they can be used for target shooting and for hunting as well. Some states have regulation that says you can only hunt with a crossbow if (X) or (Y), but other states allow crossbow to be used by any person for hunting.</p>
