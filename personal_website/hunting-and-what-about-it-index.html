            <h3>Hunting is an activity that has been a part of the lives of humans as long as they have existed. The methods of harvesting the hunt has changed and evolved as millennia have passed. What used to be sharpened sticks and broken rocks is now hard metal and scientific wonder. My goal is to enlighten you on what people use to take down and harvest their own big game in the world of today, namely, rifle and archery</h3>

            <h1>Why do people hunt game and what even is game?</h1>
            <img id="last outdoors" src="images/outdoors2.jpg" alt="Being outdoors rocks">
            <p>Game is what wild animals are called when huntable. There are a few concrete reasons that people hunt animals. One of which is to provide food for family or community. In ancient times, a deer or other animal would be shared with the entire community to provide sustenance. In modern times people may still decide to share what they have harvested with others that are like them, or they may keep the meat for themselves. Others will hunt game for trophies and will donate the meat that they would have gotten to another group of people who need it. This is more commonly done on a safari. </p>
