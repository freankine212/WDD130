        <h2>What is hunting?</h2>
        Hunting is an activity that has been a part of the lives of humans as long as they have existed. The methods of harvesting the hunt has changed and evolved as millennia have passed. What used to be sharpened sticks and broken rocks is now hard metal and scientific wonder. My goal is to enlighten you on what people use to take down and harvest their own big game in the world of today, namely, rifle and archery
        <h2>Why do people hunt game and what even is game?</h2>
        Game is what wild animals are called when huntable. There are a few concrete reasons that people hunt animals. One of which is to provide food for family or community. In ancient times, a deer or other animal would be shared with the entire community to provide sustenance. In modern times people may still decide to share what they have harvested with others that are like them, or they may keep the meat for themselves. Others will hunt game for trophies and will donate the meat that they would have gotten to another group of people who need it. This is more commonly done on a safari.

      <h3>Methods of hunting</h3>
      <p>
        <h2>Rifles</h2> 
        Rifles are a relatively new method used for hunting game. They were initially used for war in the Middle Ages but have evolved to not just be for war but also for hunting and fun. There is a sense of joy and glee at taking down your prey from more than 200 yards away. Knowing that you are the apex predator there to provide for your family is a feeling that one can only get when harvesting their own meat. There are many different types of rifles for many different types of people. 
        <h2>Archery</h2>
        Bows have been around for thousands of years. Mongols use short bows to battle and to hunt with. The British in the middle ages used bows for battle and also to hunt with. Compared to rifle hunting, bow hunting is a different ball game entirely. When hunting with a bow the objective is to get anywhere from 5 yards to maybe at most 70 yards to successfully hit and harvest the target. Archery can be divided into three camps, Longbows, Compound Bows and even Crossbows. All three are viable methods of take when it comes to hunting.  There are many different types of each type of bow and they all work for the intended purposes made for.
        <h2>Crossbows</h2>
        Crossbows are a step in archery hunting. They were initially developed to punch through knights armor in a battle but now they can be used for target shooting and for hunting as well. Some states have regulation that says you can only hunt with a crossbow if (X) or (Y), but other states allow crossbow to be used by any person for hunting.

      <h3>But... why though?</h3>
      <p>
        <h2>Why do people continue to hunt even though you can buy meat in stores?</h2>
        Hunting is a phenomenal way to keep the population of an animal in check. In places where hunting is not allowed, there are too many animals usually and that can cause the animal population to actually die out. When a place allows the controlled hunting of game, it can allow the population to stay in check and not overpopulate. If there is no control, then the population will decrease until there is nothing left. By actively hunting and harvesting game, it allows for an animal population to become stronger and more fit to survive harsh elements like snow and heat as there is enough resources for them to survive during those times.

        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <p>         
        I know it has a lot of text boxes, but the wireframe template I was using didnt have a button for links, so i just used text boxes to annotate where the link was going to go. Should be one for home, page 2, page 3 and site plan in the header, and then one for home, siteplan and page 2 in the footer.
